React is fast js  library
it used on SPA(single page application)
works with components(parts).
uses vitrual Dom (i.e. reloads only the required component)


Note: When we run our code in browser it runs on V8 engine node.js configures V8 Engine in our laptop so that we can do browser task on our locall machine.(console.log)

NPM whenever we install a package it puts it into the system then used in the working process(movie >> download >> watch)
nut in NPX it is directly installed into the working process and not in entire system..(movie >> watch e.g utube)


module 

npm init -y
in module file add "type":"module" for module or  as "Commonjs"

there are 2 types of export:
default : only one export e.g export default funcName
Named: if there are more than 1 function to export e.g export{funcName1, funcName2} Note while importing use '{}'

we can also create alias import {sumData as sum}


creat react application

npx create-react-app filename 
npm start(to start the server or project)

package.json = shows all library wwe have installed

RFC = reactfunctioncomponent f


Blank fragment - <> </>

If there is single tag then you can keep it like that , if there are multiple tags then create a parent div tag and append them as child

In componentt first letter is always caps

Using BOOTSTRAP in react:

terminal : npm i bootstrap 

import this two things in index.js:

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle";

REACT-BOOTSTRAP : (Container)

terminal : npm i react-bootstrap 
website : https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app

PROPS: sending data from parent to child

we can assign obj str to props
also we can perform destructuting on props. we can destruct it while its been passed in child with the help of destructuring

children props = creating tags with the name of the file and then accessing it in the child function by using children keyword, use {children} where we want to show data.If we are passing arr of obj then make sure to pass a key props that make sre each obj is unique.

FontAwesome commands to setup for icons:

npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
npm i --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome@latest

we can access fontAwesome icons by using a component named <FontAwesomeIcons icon = {fasmile}/> icon is used to get specific icon.


TailWind CSS :

Do this on new react project where we have not implemented bootstrap and fontawesome:

npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init and keep following the remaining steps on https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app
